# ASCII Agent — VS Code Extension

> Silently maintains ASCII file-tree and architecture diagrams for your workspace.

## What It Does

ASCII Agent watches your workspace and autonomously keeps two strictly separated ASCII text diagrams up to date:

| Diagram                     | Output File             | Description                               |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Physical File Tree**      | `docs/file_tree.txt`    | Directory structure with inline type tags |
| **Conceptual Architecture** | `docs/architecture.txt` | Data-flow diagram generated by Copilot AI |

## Requirements

- VS Code ≥ 1.93
- GitHub Copilot (for architecture diagram generation)

## Quick Start

1. Open any workspace in VS Code.
2. Run **ASCII Agent: Initialize** from the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`).
3. ASCII Agent creates `docs/file_tree.txt` and `docs/architecture.txt` immediately, then watches for changes.

## Commands

| Command                          | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ASCII Agent: Initialize`        | Creates `docs/`, default `.asciirc.json`, and generates both diagrams       |
| `ASCII Agent: Generate Now`      | Manually regenerates both diagrams with a cancellable progress notification |
| `ASCII Agent: Toggle Auto-Watch` | Pauses or resumes automatic monitoring (resets on reload)                   |

## Configuration (`.asciirc.json`)

Place a `.asciirc.json` file in your workspace root to customize behavior. All fields are optional; missing fields fall back to defaults.

```jsonc
{
  // Paths/patterns to ignore in the file tree
  "ignore": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist", "out", ".ascii_history"],

  // Glob patterns that trigger architecture re-analysis on change
  "architectureWatchPatterns": ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}", "api/**/*.ts"],

  // Output file locations (relative to workspace root)
  "outputPaths": {
    "fileTree": "docs/file_tree.txt",
    "architecture": "docs/architecture.txt",
  },

  // Milliseconds to wait after last file event before regenerating (min 500)
  "debounceMs": 2000,

  // Maximum history snapshots to retain in .ascii_history/
  "maxHistorySnapshots": 50,

  // Start watching automatically on activation
  "autoWatchEnabled": true,

  // Extra files fed as context to the architecture LM prompt
  "contextFiles": ["docs/design.md"],

  // Priority-ordered globs for token-budget truncation
  "filePriority": ["src/index.ts", "src/**"],

  // Custom tag map (replaces defaults entirely when provided)
  "tags": {
    "src/components/**": "[ui]",
    "api/**": "[backend]",
    "*.json": "[config]",
  },
}
```

## History Snapshots

Before every architecture overwrite, ASCII Agent saves a timestamped snapshot to `.ascii_history/` in your workspace root. Add this directory to `.gitignore` — ASCII Agent will prompt you to do this automatically.

## Status Bar

The `$(eye) ASCII Agent` item in the status bar shows the watcher state. Click it to toggle auto-watch on/off. During generation it shows a spinner: `$(sync~spin) ASCII Agent: generating...`

## Output Channel

All diagnostic output is written to the **ASCII Agent** output channel (`View → Output → ASCII Agent`).

## Portability

ASCII Agent is fully project-agnostic. It contains zero hardcoded project names or file paths. All paths are resolved from the active workspace root and driven by `.asciirc.json`. It works in any VS Code workspace with Copilot enabled.

## Development (running locally without installing)

This is for testing the extension while actively working on it.

**One-time setup:**

```bash
cd tools/vscode-ascii-agent
npm install
```

**Steps to run:**

1. In VS Code, open `tools/vscode-ascii-agent/` as your workspace root (File → Open Folder → select that folder). This is required so VS Code can find `.vscode/launch.json`.
2. Press `F5` (or **Run → Start Debugging**) and select **Run ASCII Agent Extension**.
3. VS Code builds the extension automatically, then opens a **second VS Code window** called the "Extension Development Host." Your extension is live inside that window.
4. In the Extension Development Host window, open your target project folder (File → Open Folder). For example, open `word-for-word-game/`.
5. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` and run **ASCII Agent: Initialize** to test.

**Rebuilding after code changes:**

- Stop the debugger, press `F5` again to rebuild and relaunch, OR
- Run `node esbuild.mjs --watch` in a terminal for continuous rebuilds, then use **Developer: Reload Window** in the Extension Development Host to pick up changes without restarting the debugger.

## Installing as a Packaged Extension

Once the extension is ready for distribution, you can package and install it locally without needing a second window or debug mode.

**Package it:**

```bash
cd tools/vscode-ascii-agent
npm install -g @vscode/vsce   # install packaging tool (one-time)
vsce package                   # produces ascii-agent-x.x.x.vsix
```

**Install it:**

```bash
code --install-extension ascii-agent-x.x.x.vsix
```

Or in VS Code: open the Extensions panel → `...` menu → **Install from VSIX** → select the `.vsix` file.

After installing, the extension activates automatically in any workspace. No second window needed — it behaves like any other installed VS Code extension.
